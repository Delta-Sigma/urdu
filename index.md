# Digital Urdu Resources

Most resources listed here require use of support of Urdu language on your keyboard. Please install keyboard first.

## USUALLY IMPORTANT FIRST STEP: Installing Necessary Keyboards and Understanding How to Use Them
This tutorial currently assumes you know how to install support for other languages in your PC or mobile phone. In the later updates, we will link to the steps for those as well. 

Sadly, these keyboards don't work like we naturally expect them to work. There are some caveats to take care of. For example a search for 'ÿ±ÿ¥ÿ™€í ÿØÿßÿ±' might fail because the dictionary doesn't have a space between two words and instead has an entry for 'ÿ±ÿ¥ÿ™€íÿØÿßÿ±'. This, and several more. But I can see that you are resilient and work your way around it. :)

## Dictionaries (...and Translators)

### The best two dictionaries:

- **Urdu Dictionary Board, Karachi** [Website](http://udb.gov.pk/), [Android App](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.udb.urdulughat)

  One of the two best dictionaries I have found. Also has audio pronunciations. Sweet.
  
- **Urdu Lughat** [Website](http://urdulughat.info/), [Android App](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=info.urdulughat)
  
  Does not have audio pronunciations, but has written pronunciates. The app searches words as you type, which is nice. Will give historical roots of the words. My suggestion would be to install both this and UDB one (first in the list).

### More:
- **Urdu Inc** [Website](https://www.urduinc.com/)
  
  A very good dictionary but is more of synonyms instead of detailed meanings. Arguably, that's sometimes even better than the meanings. Will also give Urdu-to-English meanings.

- **Urdu Seek** [Website](https://urduseek.com/)
  
  Sometimes when all else fails, I sometimes find meaning here and in Urdu Inc.

***Note***: These dictionary sites' search functions usually do not work as well as Google's. Using Google search by restricting it to these sites is very helpful at times. Example: 'site:urduseek.com ⁄©ÿ≥ Ÿà ŸÜÿß ⁄©ÿ≥'

### Translators:

Translators because sometimes you find a meaning by translating. ;) I usually go through these in the following order when searching for a word's or an idiom's definition.

- [**Bing Translate**](https://translate.bing.com) is better, usually. It's run in partnership with Jawaharlal Nehru University, India. Google's can't seem to translate simple words at times. However, the microsoft translator android app seems to be different and worse.
- [**Google Translate**](https://translate.google.com) The noob option.


### Dictionary Troubleshooting: What to do if you can't find a word or an idiom using any of the above?

- Try removing suffixes and prefixes.
- Try singular forms.
- Try translating from Arabic/Persian/etc. A lot of Urdu literature uses Arabic or Farsi expressions. Try translating from Arabic or Farsi to get an idea of the meaning. It's not perfect. But I found it to work at times. 

Translating **to** Arabic or Persian also gives a nice word that is perfectly usable in Urdu. e.g. Google's Translator from 'cute' gives 'ÿØŸÑŸÅÿ±€åÿ®' in Persian. But only gives 'Ÿæ€åÿßÿ±ÿß/Ÿæ€åÿßÿ±€å' in Urdu. Noob

## Displaying Urdu Properly i.e. in Nastaleeq
- MacOS

  Enable Urdu Keyboard in Region Settings. 

- iPhone
  
  Check out this post by Mudassir Azeemi:

- Android
  
  Out of luck so far.
  Maybe this can be a project for you. Write a program that can replace system's fonts' Arabic codepoints with Nastaleeq ones from Jameel Noori Nastaleeq. üòõ 

- Windows
  
  No easy way in Windows 7. I haven't used Windows' Spyware versions i.e. 8 and 10. So if you have any suggestions, feel free to contribute.
